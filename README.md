Blood Bank Management System (OOPs in C++)

ðŸ©¸ Project Overview

This project is a Blood Bank Management System developed in C++ using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It offers a console-based interface for managing blood donors, recipients, and maintaining blood inventory efficiently.

ðŸ”§ Features

Donor registration and donation tracking

Blood request and billing system

Blood inventory management by blood group

Admin login with secure access

Real-time availability check for blood units

ðŸ§± OOP Concepts Used

Classes and Objects â€“ Defined for users, patients, donors, and billing

Inheritance â€“ Patient inherits from User class

Polymorphism â€“ Achieved via virtual functions for flexible behavior

Encapsulation â€“ Data hidden within classes, accessed via methods

Abstraction â€“ Simplified interfaces hide internal logic from the user

Friend Functions (Optional extension) â€“ Can be used for file I/O

Operator Overloading (Optional extension) â€“ Can support inventory operations

Templates (Optional extension) â€“ Generic billing or reporting features

ðŸŽ“ Purpose

Built to demonstrate real-world application of OOP in C++, especially for interviewers assessing understanding of object-oriented design.
